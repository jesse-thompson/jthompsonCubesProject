<h1>Jesse Thompson's CUBES Project</h1>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>

- secrets.template is to be used as a template for 
holding the API key in a file "secrets.py"
- Wufoo form: https://jessethompson.wufoo.com/forms/z1pdyem009hdgsr/

<h3>Description:</h3>

This program retrieves the data entries of a Wufoo form and save it into a
SQL database.<br>
The database consists of a single table and is and contains all entry data retrieved from the server.
The order of organization is the same as it is retrieved.
The field names are adapted to be easily understood.

When you click the organization names, it will show a message box with
the information from the entry.

The tests on GitHub Actions definitely don't work, even if there are any tests for the GUI, which there probably aren't.
